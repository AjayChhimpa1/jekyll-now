#### Handwritten Digit Recognition - Python, Tensorflow, CNN, max-pooling, regularization
------
A Convolutional neural network model in Tensorflow for handwritten digit recognition using MNIST
data set. Used two convolutional layers with max-pooling, two fully connected layers, Adam
optimization algorithm and dropout for regularization achieving an accuracy of around 99.4%.
    
    
#### Image Caption generator - Python, CNN, LSTM, InceptionV3 model
------
Extracted features of images using pretrained InceptionV3 model, used CNN, LSTM (Long Short-Term
Memory) and beam search to generate automatic descriptions for images. Model is trained on
Flickr8K data set.


#### Neural Style Transfer - Python, Tensorflow, VGG-19, Transfer learning
------
Used VGG-19 model trained on ImageNet data to achieve transfer learning and calculated the
content loss and style loss to create artistic style images.


#### Neural Machine Translation - Python, Keras, Bi-LSTM, Attention mechanism
------
Developed a Neural Machine Translation model in Keras using Bi-directional LSTM and Attention
mechanism to translate human readable dates into machine readable dates.

#### Fake News Classification - Python, Naïve Bayes, SVM, scikit-learn, nltk
------
Used Naïve Bayes and SVM algorithms to classify news articles as fake/real. F1 score and accuracy of
both were around 96% on test data. Implemented in python using nltk, sklearn and numpy modules.
