    I am a final year Computer Engineering Undergraduate student at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, Patiala, India.
    <p>
        Currently I'm working at <a href="https://maqsoftware.com/", target="_blank">MAQ Software</a>, Hyderabad, as a Software intern. 
        Here at MAQ Software, I'm a part of Text analytics (VoC analytics) team. 
        My current project is to analyse customer feedbacks provided by client using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Algorithms. 
        I have also helped my team to design and develop Machine learning courses for internal (company) learning portal. 
        I mostly code in python-3 and have experience in python libraries: scikit-learn, Tensorlflow, Keras, gensim, nltk.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I have completed quite few online courses to enhance my technical capabalities. Recently I have completed deep learning specialization by Andrew NG, on Coursera and learned about Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, mathematical details about ANN, CNN, RNN, LSTM and how they can be used in real world projects, check out some my
